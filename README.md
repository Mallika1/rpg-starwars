1. When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight   as that character for the rest of the game.


2. The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Enemies should be moved to a different area of the screen.
3. The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.
4. Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a defender area.
5. The player will now be able to click the attack button.
